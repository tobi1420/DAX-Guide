In Dax, whenever a filter is applied, either as an external or internal filter, this filter is defined in the dimension table and then propagated to the fact table.
External filters originates from the visuals of a Power BI report. This includes slicers, Matrix Rows and Columns, Crossfilter from other visuals etc.

Lets say the following external filters are applied in a report: 

    'Calendar'[Year] = 2023,
    'Product'[Category] IN {"Beverage", "Food"}

It is required that there are relationsships between the two dimensions ('Calendar' and 'Product') towards the fact 'Sales'. These must be 1:* with a unidirectional filter.

Now, to apply these filters, the engine creates an Expanded table, which is a table consisting of the entire Fact table and the relevant columns from the dimensions.

The fact table would consist of: 

'Sales'
[Product ID], [Transaction Date], [Quantity], [Unit Price].

The dimensions tables consists of: 

'Product'
[Product ID], [Product Category]

'Calendar'
[Year], [Transaction Date]

To apply the external filters, the following expanded table is created:
[Product ID], [Transaction Date], [Quantity], [Unit Price] -- 'Product -- [Product Category] -- Calendar[Year]

Now it is visually interpretable that the suggested filters can be applied, since the expanded table can compute the desired filter.

The evaluation order for a filter in Power BI is always:
1) External Filters applied by the user
2) Internal Filters applied by the developer, FILTER (ALL)...
3) The execution of the desired measure, based on the filters.
